This will be a seminar on classic and contemporary work on central topics in ethics. The first third of the course will focus on **metaethics**: we will examine the meaning of moral claims and ask whether there is any sense in which moral principles are objectively valid. The second third of the course will focus on **normative ethics**: what makes our lives worth living, what makes our actions right or wrong, and what do we owe to others? The final third of the course will focus on **moral character**: what is virtue, and how important is it? Can we be held responsible for what we do? When and why?
